  hooks:
    - go mod tidy
builds:
- env:
  - CGO_ENABLED=0
  flags:
      # try to prevent paths from local system from leaking into build
      - -trimpath
  ldflags:
      # this is the default without the date being set. The date would
      # prevent build reproducibility. Similarly, we must set the buildid
      # to be the empty string.
      # goreleaser normally uses '-s -w' in these flags to suppress the
      # symbol table and debug info, but I think we probably want to include
      # that right now so that we can debug official builds without losing
      # our minds.
